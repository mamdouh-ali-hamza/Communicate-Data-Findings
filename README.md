# Ford GoBike System Data Findings:
## by Mamdouh Ali


## Dataset

>  I will conduct an exploratory data analysis on Ford GoBike System Data. I will use Python data science and data visualization libraries to explore the dataset’s variables and understand the data’s structure and relationships. The analysis should be going from simple univariate relationships up to bivariate relationships through multivariate relationships. Then, I will take my main findings from my exploration and convey them through an explanatory analysis. I will create a slide deck that leverages polished explanatory visualizations to communicate my results. This document explores a dataset containing the trip data of the ford gobike approximately 174,952 with 13 features.Variables are numerical, and others are datetime and string.


## Summary of Findings

> Trip Duration is so dependendable on the age of the member, when the age between 20 to 45, the trip duration is higher than the older ages. For the age, duration, and gender, for the others leap at an older age (around 60 years) to got 50 trip duration. For the age, duration, and user type, both Customer and Subscriber are showing similar trends for age and trip duration, but for subscribers the trip duration is higher for older age.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Distribution of Trip Durations: Trip Durations in the dataset take on a very large range of values. Number of Trips values first increases starting from around 8000 values to 12500 values at peak around 10 minutes but then starts to fall below at 2000 values. Distribution of User Age: In the case of age, the distribution is more concentrated between 20 to 40 years old.
